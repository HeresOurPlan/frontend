# frontend

**This directory is not required, you can delete it if you don't want to use it.**

This directory contains your Vuex Store files.
Vuex Store option is implemented in the Nuxt.js framework.

Creating a file in this directory automatically activates the option in the framework.

More information about the usage of this directory in [the documentation](https://nuxtjs.org/guide/vuex-store).

Steps to run the file:

Run npm install to retrieve all necessary dependencies
Run npm run dev to open up a localhost on your browser. (Do note that backend has to run first before running this)
